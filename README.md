# MetaNetwork
A user hosted irc revamp with politics packaged into the individual forums. 
Serverless with content being served from workstations.
files shared are to be spread across workstations in order to keep anonymity.
Think of each forum as reddit, 4chan, Wikipedia, things of their own design, their own way of handling internal politics.

It's just forums and file sharing.

Each society will decide what it will make anonymous and what it will make public.
There will be votes (if the society decicides to via it's created politics), and there will be justice.

Example:
User creates a new forum. Like an IRC channel.
(Didn't exist before the user, and won't after the user is gone.)
User X creates the rules, 
Democracy? Sure!
Anonymity? Sure!

Later the forum decides to have a vote, and decides to make the forum public, so be it.

Invite only? Sure! [you can vote on this too].

That's the thing, it's always adating, every forum is adapting!

## Q&A:
How do we make sure the societies don't fragment?
We don't/ we can't. Thats the thing about societies, they govern themselves.

What's the point?
To take scarcity out of the equation (resources (food/water/electricity/land)).
To let the Communists try it (One more time).
To allow people to choose their own adventure, to choose their own dialogue within a comunnity.

## Possible plans:
Make communities private unless you know the name. (Possibly have communities that are just for spotting communities people may desire to be a part of (Like a bulletin board)) 

### MTN Protocol
The way that data is transferred is to be through a new protocol, called "mtn", pronounced mountain, short for MetaNetwork.
this is to be a way to clearly seperate it from http or a website, this is to be completely seperate from a standard website protocol, something closer to torrents.

### The Library
In the library is stored the Archives of conversation pieces that forums have decided politically to put into the archive.
The forums are to decide amongst these things before submitting to the Library:
1. Anonymity. (t/f)
2. Length. (# of posts or time in day/month/year Hour/Minute/Second)
3. Continuing afterwards (t/f)
  3a. Length of continuity.

The library is to be viewed by all (even not part of the site).

The forums are to decide whether they can be seen by search engines or any web crawler.

# Think of all of this as a IRC channel where there are only mods if you decide and there are only rules if you so desire. Those rules are up to the creater, and maybe even you.

# That is all for now.
